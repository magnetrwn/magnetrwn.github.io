                    <span class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">About Me</span>
                    Hello! I'm a full-stack developer and a university student studying Computer Science. I'm passionate about coding and enjoy creating structured desktop and web applications, as well as efficient database design and more!

                    <span class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">My Journey</span>
                    My journey in the world of programming began when I embarked on my Computer Science degree. Over the years, I've had the opportunity to explore various aspects of web development, from building interactive front-end interfaces to creating robust back-end systems.

                    <span class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">A Balancing Act</span>
                    Balancing my academic pursuits with my role as a full-stack developer has been both challenging and rewarding. As a student, I'm constantly learning and expanding my knowledge in computer science, while as a developer, I apply this knowledge to create practical solutions for clients and users.

                    <span class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">What Drives Me</span>
                    What drives me in this field is the endless potential for innovation and the power of technology to transform lives. I thrive on the thrill of solving complex problems and the creative process of bringing ideas to life through coding.

                    <span class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">Beyond the Code</span>
                    When I'm not immersed in lines of code or studying, I enjoy exploring the intersections of technology and other domains, from mobile app development to competitive programming and machine learning. I'm also an active member of my university's Computer Science Society, where I serve as the Vice President for External Affairs.

                    <span class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">Leading the Way</span>
                    In addition to my academic and development endeavors, I take on leadership roles as the Team Captain in various university teams, including Competitive Programming, Machine Learning, Web Development, and more. These experiences have allowed me to sharpen my skills in teamwork, communication, and project management.

                    <span class="font-bold text-xl md:text-2xl">Thank You for Visiting</span>
